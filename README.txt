INTRODUCTION

------------

WinterLab is an open-source integrated electronics test and measurement platform, designed for use at the undergraduate level. The full platform consists of the WinterLab board (a microcontroller-based development board) and a graphical user interface (GUI). It is named after the cold weather commonly encountered around the institution at which it was developed.

- executables: self-contained programs, runnable out of the box on Mac, Ubuntu, and Windows
- winterlab: source code for the GUI (Python)
- winterlab_firmware: source code for the microcontroller (C++ / Arduino scripting language). The firmware was designed to run on a Teensy 3.6, but can be adapted for other similar development boards by changing pinout and updating some register assignments.
- hardware: photographs of assembled boards and circuit schematics. Printed circuit board design files, such as Gerber files and/or Altium projects, are available upon request; please contact maclean.rouble@mail.mcgill.ca.
